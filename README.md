# vue-qrcode-reader

A set of Vue.js components for detecting QR codes and various other barcode formats right in the browser:

* ðŸŽ¥ `QrcodeStream` continuously scans frames from a camera stream.
* ðŸš® `QrcodeDropZone` is an empty region where you can drag-and-drop images to be decoded.
* ðŸ“‚ `QrcodeCapture` is a classic file upload field, instantly scanning all files you select.

This project is forked from [gruhn/vue-qrcode-reader](https://github.com/gruhn/vue-qrcode-reader),which I modified in my own style and solved the problem of not being able to select photo files on the mobile side
